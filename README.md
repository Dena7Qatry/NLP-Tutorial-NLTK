# Natural Language Processing (NLP) Tutorial with NLTK

This repository contains a step-by-step tutorial on **Natural Language Processing (NLP) using the **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)** library in Python., implemented in a Colab notebook. The tutorial introduces fundamental NLP concepts and demonstrates how to apply them with practical code examples.


## Overview
The tutorial walks through fundamental NLP tasks such as:
- Loading and exploring raw text data
- Text preprocessing: tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and lemmatization
- Frequency distribution of words
- Preparing text for further analysis

## Files:
- **nlp_with_nltk.ipynb**: Main tutorial notebook that includes code, explanations, and outputs.

## Requirements
The notebook is designed for Google Colab but can also run locally with Python.  
Dependencies include:
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `nltk`

You may need to download NLTK resources such as:
```python
import nltk
nltk.download("popular")
nltk.download("punkt")
